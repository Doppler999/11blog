## Introduction

It can be hard to compete against the millions of blogs that clutter the internet. But in podcasting, where you face just a fraction of the competition, things are a little different.

No wonder podcasting is seen as a viable marketing channel for businesses of all sizes, from fewer than ten employees to over 500.

The real challenge isn’t launching a podcast, though—it’s making a mark.

How can you make your podcast stand out? How do you ensure your voice is heard?

To answer these questions and learn more about podcast marketing, my team at NP Digital commissioned two surveys. The first surveyed 1,000 U.S. marketers who used podcasts to promote their business. The second gathered insights from 1,000 podcast listeners in the U.S.

Whether you’re wondering how to market your podcast more effectively or looking for ways to kickstart your podcast promotion, you’re in the right place.

In this article, I’ll combine my agency’s independent research with marketing best practices to help you learn how to market a podcast and amplify your reach.

## #1: Know Your Audience and Niche

The most common motivation for marketers to start a podcast (picked by over 30 percent of respondents) is to find an alternative way to reach their audience.

If that’s the case for you, then you’d better understand who you’re talking to and how you can serve them. This isn’t just about demographics or interests—it’s about knowing their pain points, why they listen to you, and what they want to get out of your podcast.

Our research found the most common motives for listening to podcasts were entertainment (70.1 percent) and staying informed (63 percent). Exploring personal interests and passions was also a common reason chosen by over 55 percent of the 1,000 listeners we surveyed.

Don’t fall into the trap of thinking your podcast audience wants the same thing as your blog readers or YouTube viewers, though. They may be interested in the same topic or genre, but looking for you to deliver the information in a vastly different way.

How do you pinpoint your audience and niche? Start with the basics: conduct surveys within your existing audience, engage in social listening to understand what topics resonate, and analyze competitors to identify gaps in the market.
